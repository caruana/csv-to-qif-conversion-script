# CSV to QIF Conversion Script

My bank only supports exporting CSV or QXF files. My budgeting app needs QIF files. This script reads the CSV and maps the fields to the correct QIF format.

Change the path to the CSV you want to convert and run `npm run convert` in the terminal.

There's a good chance that this does not match the mapping you require in particular, but this could be a starting point for your own script.
